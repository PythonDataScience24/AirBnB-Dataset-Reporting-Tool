In data_manipulation.py we created two try/except blocks.
Both are checking, if there are invalid inputs.
(invalid inputs: not numbers, number < 0, number >= length dataframe)
One is for the start and one is for the end row. 
If it's not valid, then it prints, that the input is not valid, and it 
gives the range, which you can use from.
